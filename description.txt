This mod adds decorative items. I plan to keep adding to it. So far it has:

- Aquarium.
- Bonsai Tree.
- Medusa Painting and Ned the Nosey Statue. They're very nosey.
- Peaceful Plantera's Bulb.
- Placeable fake versions of ambient objects (for example: Enchanted sword in Stone).
- Trellis with Empty, Vine, and Flower variants. Flower variants come in 12 colors.
- Vines and Flower Vines (12 colors).
- Fake versions of pots + Granite Pot.
