Dragon's Decorative Mod

====INFO====

Open Source at GitHub. Report issues there or at home page.

NOTE: "Shop Expander" mod is recommended and may be necessary for shop items to appear.

This mod adds decorative items with configuration settings to disable them. I plan to keep adding to it. As of version 1.25 (March 20th 2023) it has:

- "WikiThis" mod support
- Placeable versions of vanilla tiles
- 76 Non-vanilla Tiles

You can find example pictures and a link to the wiki on the forum page.
