NOTE: "Shop Expander" mod is recommended and may be necessary for shop items to appear.

This mod adds decorative items. I plan to keep adding to it. As of version 1.18 (Oct 4th 2022) it has:

- 2 Background Blocks
- 1 Wall
- 40 Furniture Items
- Support for "Wikithis" mod.

You can find example pictures and a link to the wiki on the forum page.
